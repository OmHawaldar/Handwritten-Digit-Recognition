# Handwritten Digit Recognition using MNIST Dataset

This project implements a Handwritten Digit Recognition system using the MNIST dataset. It uses TensorFlow, OpenCV, and Pygame to train a model and later recognize digits drawn in a Pygame window.

## Project Setup

**1. Setting Up the Environment:**
   * **Virtual Environment:**
     - Activate the virtual environment:
       - Windows: `digit-recognition-env\Scripts\activate`
       - macOS/Linux: `source digit-recognition-env/bin/activate`
   * **Install Dependencies:**
     ```bash
     pip install tensorflow opencv-python pygame matplotlib pandas numpy
     ```

**2. Model Training:**
   * Load the MNIST dataset.
   * Build and train a model using TensorFlow.
   * Save the trained model.

**3. Run the main python file :**
   * Load the saved model into the main application with .py extension.
   * Implement digit drawing and recognition functionalities in the Pygame window.

**4. Running the Application:**
   * Run the Python script to start the Pygame application.
   * Draw digits in the window and observe the model's predictions.
